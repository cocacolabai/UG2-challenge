# UG2-challenge-Track2.1-Object Detection in Haze
We have created an easy algorithm to add synthesis haze to any existing dataset. We use COCO dataset with synthesis haze to train Mask RCNN model and get much better mAP results in object detection in haze challenge than Mask RCNN model trained with original COCO dataset.

More instructions on how to run the test code, check it inside the folder.
